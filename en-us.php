Sounds like a pretty obvious definition, doesn't it? But do you know how this is done or, before that, what is software?

Software is a virtual product, consisting essentially of a set of codes - instructions written in a particular computer language.

When the user goes to use software, however, he does not see codes.

This is because these instructions will be translated on the screen of electronic equipment and presented different actions or even materialized in some types of devices.

Developers (or 'devs' in category jargon) are programmers, meaning they write the program from the code mentioned above.

But not every programmer is a developer.

Because this nickname is attributed to professionals who participate in the entire software development process.

It is not enough, therefore, just to write codes.

The developer needs to know how to conduct a project from conception, understanding what the customer needs.

A job that involves listening, gathering information, prototyping, testing, tuning, approving and implementing.

Software development is a complex activity that requires a lot of technical knowledge.

Hence the high added value of the function.";
